## Repository structure

The repository has the following structure:

```tree
.
├── dependencies
├── docs
├── model_conditioning_examples
├── resources
├── /resources_downloaded/
├── scripts
│   └── ...
├── source
│   ├── application
│   │ ├── hal
│   │ ├── main
│   │ └── tensorflow-lite-micro
│   └── use_case
│     └── <usecase_name>
│          ├── include
│          ├── src
│          └── usecase.cmake
├── tests
│   └── ...
└── CMakeLists.txt
```

What these folders contain:

- `dependencies`: All the third-party dependencies for this project.

- `docs`: The documentation for this ML application.

- `model_conditioning_examples`: short example scripts that demonstrate some methods available in TensorFlow
    to condition your model in preparation for deployment on Arm Ethos NPU.

- `resources`: contains ML use-cases applications resources such as input data, label files, etc.

- `resources_downloaded`: created by `set_up_default_resources.py`, contains downloaded resources for ML use-cases
    applications such as models, test data, etc.

- `scripts`: Build and source generation scripts.

- `source`: C/C++ sources for the platform and ML applications.
    > **Note:** Common code related to the `Ethos-U55` NPU software framework resides in *application* subfolder.

  The contents of the *application* subfolder is as follows:

  - `application`: All sources that form the *core* of the application. The `use-case` part of the sources depend on the
    sources themsleves, such as:

    - `hal`: Contains Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) sources, providing a platform agnostic API to access hardware
      platform-specific functions.

    - `main`: Contains the main function and calls to platform initialization logic to set up things before launching
      the main loop. Also contains sources common to all use-case implementations.

    - `tensorflow-lite-micro`: Contains abstraction around TensorFlow Lite Micro API. This abstraction implements common
      functions to initialize a neural network model, run an inference, and access inference results.

  - `use_case`: Contains the ML use-case specific logic. Stored as a separate subfolder, it helps isolate the
    ML-specific application logic. With the assumption that the `application` performs the required setup for logic to
    run. It also makes it easier to add a new use-case block.

  - `tests`: Contains the x86 tests for the use-case applications.

The HAL has the following structure:

```tree
hal
├── hal.c
├── include
│   └── ...
└── platforms
    ├── bare-metal
    │   ├── bsp
    │   │   ├── bsp-core
    │   │   │   └── include
    │   │   ├── bsp-packs
    │   │   │   └── mps3
    │   │   ├── cmsis-device
    │   │   ├── include
    │   │   └── mem_layout
    │   ├── data_acquisition
    │   ├── data_presentation
    │   │   ├── data_psn.c
    │   │   └── lcd
    │   │       └── include
    │   ├── images
    │   ├── timer
    │   └── utils
    └── native
```

What these folders contain:

- The folders `include` and `hal.c` contain the HAL top-level platform API and data acquisition, data presentation, and
  timer interfaces.
    > **Note:** the files here and lower in the hierarchy have been written in C and this layer is a clean C/ + boundary
    > in the sources.

- `platforms/bare-metal/data_acquisition`\
  `platforms/bare-metal/data_presentation`\
  `platforms/bare-metal/timer`\
  `platforms/bare-metal/utils`:

  These folders contain the bare-metal HAL support layer and platform initialization helpers. Function calls are routed
  to platform-specific logic at this level. For example, for data presentation, an `lcd` module has been used. This
  `lcd` module wraps the LCD driver calls for the actual hardware (for example, MPS3).

- `platforms/bare-metal/bsp/bsp-packs`: The core low-level drivers (written in C) for the platform reside. For supplied
  examples, this happens to be an MPS3 board. However, support can be added here for other platforms. The functions
  defined in this space are wired to the higher-level functions under HAL and is like those in the
  `platforms/bare-metal/` level).

- `platforms/bare-metal/bsp/bsp-packs/mps3/include`\
  `platforms/bare-metal/bsp/bsp-packs/mps3`: Contains the peripheral (LCD, UART, and timer) drivers specific to MPS3
  board.

- `platforms/bare-metal/bsp/bsp-core`\
  `platforms/bare-metal/bsp/include`: Contains the BSP core sources common to all BSPs and includes a UART header.
  However, the implementation of this is platform-specific, while the API is common. Also "re-targets" the standard
  output and error streams to the UART block.

- `platforms/bare-metal/bsp/cmsis-device`: Contains the CMSIS template implementation for the CPU and also device
  initialization routines. It is also where the system interrupts are set up and the handlers are overridden. The main
  entry point of a bare-metal application most likely resides in this space. This entry point is responsible for the
  set-up before calling the user defined "main" function in the higher-level `application` logic.

- `platforms/bare-metal/bsp/mem_layout`: Contains the platform-specific linker scripts.

When using *Ethos-U55* NPU backend, Vela compiler optimizes the the NN model. However, if not and it is supported by
TensorFlow Lite Micro, then it falls back on the CPU and execute.

![Vela compiler](./media/vela_flow.jpg)

The Vela compiler is a tool that can optimize a neural network model into a version that run on an embedded system
containing the *Ethos-U55* NPU.

The optimized model contains custom operators for sub-graphs of the model that the *Ethos-U55* NPU can accelerate. The
remaining layers that cannot be accelerated, are left unchanged, and are run on the CPU using optimized, `CMSIS-NN`, or
reference kernels provided by the inference engine.

For detailed information, see: [Optimize model with Vela compiler](./sections/building.md#Optimize-custom-model-with-Vela-compiler).

## Building

This section describes how to build the code sample applications from sources and includes illustrating the build
options and the process.

The project can be built for MPS3 FPGA and FVP emulating MPS3. Using default values for configuration parameters builds
executable models that support the *Ethos-U55* NPU.

## Implementing custom ML application

This section describes how to implement a custom Machine Learning application running on a platform supported by the
repository, either an FVP or an MPS3 board.

Both the *Cortex-M55* CPU and *Ethos-U55* NPU Code Samples software project offers a way to incorporate extra use-case
code into the existing infrastructure. It also provides a build system that automatically picks up added functionality
and produces corresponding executable for each use-case.
